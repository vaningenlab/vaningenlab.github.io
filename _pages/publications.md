* **NMR-driven integrative structure of the RNF168-nucleosome complex explains Ub specificity**  
V. Horn\*, M. Uckelmann\*, H. Zhang, J. Eerland, I. Aarsman, U.B. le Paige, C. Davidovich, T.K. Sixma and H. van Ingen (2019). Nat. Commun.  
Ubiquitination of H2A K13/K15 is an important regulatory signal in control of DNA damage repair.  
The E3 enzyme RNF168 controls the specificity of this reaction, making sure only K13/15 in H2A get ubiuitinated.  
We used NMR, mutagenesis and cross-linking mass-spectrometry to get an insightful integrative structure,  
that show in deatil how anchoring of the RNF168 to the nucleosome acidic patch position the E2~Ub above the targeted lysines.  
This work was a collaboration with the Sixma group at the Netherlands Cancer Institute.

* **Beyond the nucleosome**  
The structure-function relationship of chromatin is a complex, multi-scale problem.  
In this review, we examined the interplay between higher-order chromatin structure and nucleosome-nucleosome and nucleosome-protein interactions.

* **Let's roll and make nucleosomal DNA**  
We developed a flexible method to produce large quantities of genomic nucleosomal DNA, based on rolling-circle-amplification (RCA).  
This will facilitate structural studies of genomic nucleosomes by making it easier to produce the required DNA.

* **Peptide mimics nucleosome**
Imitating Nature is hard! Recognition of H3K36me is hevaily influenced by the nucleosomal environment.  
We attempted to mimicking this nucleosomal context in a peptide to potentially identify new inhibitors for the readers of this modification.  
The peptides indeed have increased binding affinity but an altered mode, reducing the occupancy of the aromatic cage on the reader.
