News: Paper in Science Advances and open PhD position
---------
Our work on the histone chaperone APLF has been published in Science Advances! Read the paper [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo0517) and the news release [here](https://www.uu.nl/en/news/dna-mantle-repair-happens-in-one-rather-than-several-steps) and more [here](./publications.md).
A 4-year PhD position is open in an NWO-funded project to study genomic nucleosomes and pioneer factor binding, more [here](./team.md)!

About us
---------
Our research team focusses on the molecular basis of chromatin function using an integrative approach of modern NMR, biochemistry and computation.
In particular, we are interested in the interactions of chromatin's fundamental building block, the nucleosome, and other chromatin factors and how these affect chromatin structure and function.
To this end, we make use of state-of-the art NMR methods and also develop novel approaches to study these large assemblies at atomic resolution.
In addition, the group collaborates with and supports users of the Utrecht NMR Facility, for example via [iNEXT-Discovery](https://inext-discovery.eu/network/inext-d/home) and [INSTRUCT](https://instruct-eric.eu).
