Open PhD position
----
We have an open position for a PhD student in NWO-funded project to study the structural dynamics of genomic nucleosomes and their interaction with pioneer factors.
This project starts Jan 2023 and builds on recent work in the lab on nucleosomes containing native, genomic DNA. 
If you are a highly motivated student with experience in recombinant protein work and a strong interest in structural work and NMR, read more [here](../images/PhD-position-PioneeringGenomicNucleosomes.pdf) and feel free to contact [Hugo](mailto:h.vaningen@uu.nl) for more information.
