Internships
-------------------------------------------------

THE fascinating thing about life at the molecular level is how proteins can come together to carry out a certain task in the cell. 
In our research these interactions are usally about the proteins that bind the nucleosome to regulate things like DNA repair or gene expression. 
We use state-of-the-art solution NMR spectroscopy, biochemistry and computational methods to understand how proteins specifically recognize and operate on the nucleosome. 
In collaboration with other groups we also apply this approach for other systems.

We welcome BSc and MSc students to do their internship in our team.
Projects are defined based on ongoing research projects and the preferences of the students, and can focus for example on:

* protein structure determination
* studies of protein dynamics
* NMR methods and automation
* histone chaperone function
* specific recognition of epigenetic modifications
